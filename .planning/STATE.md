## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure derived from 3 natural work streams (Python client, Zustand slices, React hooks). Below standard granularity (5-8) but authentic to the work.
- [Roadmap]: Phase order follows risk gradient -- strongest test coverage first (499 tests), then compiler-verified TypeScript, then most nuanced React lifecycle work last.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Phase 3 handler factory dependency injection pattern needs design during planning. Recommend `/gsd:research-phase` before Phase 3 implementation.
- [Research]: Verify `Sessions` class is properly re-exported during Phase 1 (found in test imports).
