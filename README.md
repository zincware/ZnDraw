# ZnDraw

Install via `pip install zndraw` or `pip install zndraw[webview]` to open zndraw
in a dedicated window.

## CLI

You can use ZnDraw with the CLI `zndraw atoms.xyz`. For a full list of arguments
use `zndraw --help`.

ZnDraw is designed to work with your Python scripts. To interface you can
inherit from `zndraw.examples.UpdateScene` or follow this base class:

```python
import abc
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UpdateScene(BaseModel, abc.ABC):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def run(self, atom_ids: list[int], atoms: ase.Atoms, **kwargs) -> list[ase.Atoms]:
        pass
```

The `run` method expects as inputs

- atom_ids: list\[int\], the ids of the currently selected atoms
- atoms: ase.Atoms, the configuration as `ase.Atoms` file where atom_ids where
  selected.
- kwargs: dict could be additional information from the scene

and as an output:

- list\[ase.Atoms\], a list of ase Atoms objects to display.

You can define the parameters using `pydantic.Field` which will be displayed in
the UI.

```python
class MyUpdateCls(UpdateScene):
    steps: int = Field(100, le=1000, ge=1)
    x: float = Field(0.5, le=5, ge=0)
    symbol: str = Field("same")
```

To add your method click on the `+` on the right side of the window. Your should
be able to add your method from the working directory via `module.MyUpdateCls`
as long as it can be imported via `from module import MyUpdateCls`.
